Encryption is the process of converting normal message (plaintext) into meaningless message (Ciphertext). Whereas Decryption is the process of converting meaningless message (Ciphertext) into its original form (Plaintext).
In this demo we will encrypt a video file with the help of python 

step 1: First install python let's say 3.6

step 2 : download below  code locally and then run the python code on your local machine

https://github.com/RonakPatel-1/DSA-challenge/blob/main/video_encrypt_decrypt.py

step 3 : Now lets say you have a video file in below location as show in screen shot.

step 4 : run the code and it will ask for user input with options:

step 5 : Enter the video file name with location as below with double quotations.

step 6 : Key will be generated and you need to keep it safe. below is the eg.

step 7 : Now the video files is successfully encrypted

step 8 : Go to that video file location and check. you can see below file encrypted with key

step 9 : Now to decrypt once again run the python code and select the decrypt option and it will ask the file location and key file location enter that in double quotes and then see the result.
